            <b>Handed out Tuesday Feb 7 2022<br>

          <h3>1. Introduction
          </h3>
          <p>
            In this assignment, you will design a new system call for xv6, and use
            it in some fork synchronization problems.  The goals of this assignment are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Understand the system call interface
            </li>
            <li>Understand how user programs send parameters to the kernel, and receive values back
            </li>
            <li>See how the event handling in the Operating System works
            </li>
            <li>Understand the process structure and modify it
            </li>
          </ul>
  
          The deliverables for the assignment are the code that includes the
          required changes (the new system call, and modifications to exit), as
          well as the user test program(s). <br>
          You will be graded by reports. Randomly seletected students (~10%) are expected to demonstrate that you understand what you did and why you did it that way.
          <br><br>
          <h3>2. Getting started</h3>
  
          Based on Lab 1 to set up xv6 on your own machine.
  
  
          <p>Open two terminal windows.  In one, enter <kbd>make
            qemu-gdb</kbd> (or <kbd>make qemu-nox-gdb</kbd>).  This starts up
            QEMU, but QEMU stops just before the
            processor executes the first instruction and waits for a debugging
            connection from GDB.  In the second terminal, from the same directory
            you ran <tt>make</tt>, run <kbd>gdb</kbd>. You should see something
            like this,
          </p>
  
          <pre>% <kbd>gdb</kbd>

            This GDB was configured as "i486-linux-gnu".
            + target remote localhost:26000
            The target architecture is assumed to be i8086

          </pre>
  
          <p> Now set a breakpoint on exec() by typing
  
            <tt>break exec</tt> in the gdb window
  
            type <tt>continue</tt>
  
            You should see something like:
          </p>
          <pre>(gdb) cont
            Continuing.

            <exec>:push   %ebp
  
              Breakpoint 1, exec (path=0x1c "/init", argv=0x8dfffe98) at exec.c:12
              12{
                (gdb)
              </exec>
            </pre>
  
            <p>
              Here we stop execution after the OS is initialized at the stage where
              it is starting the first process (init).  If you type continue again,
              you will break again as follows:
  
            </p>
            <pre>gdb) cont
              Continuing.
              [Switching to Thread 1]
              =&gt; 0x80100af8
              <exec>:push   %ebp
  
                Breakpoint 1, exec (path=0x8c3 "sh", argv=0x8dffee98) at exec.c:12
                12{
              </exec>
            </pre>
  
              <p>
                As you can see, at this stage, init started a shell process which is
                the xv6 shell we get when the OS boots.  If you continue again, gdb
                will not return since it is waiting for a command to be started in the
                shell.  Switch to the other window and try typing a command (for
                example, <tt>cat README</tt>) at which time you will get another break
                as the shell forks then execs the cat program.
  
                Feel free to look around at the program when it breaks to see how we
                reach the system call which should give you ideas about how to add
                one.
  
              <br><br>
              </p><h3>3. Assignment</h3>
  
              <p>Extend the current xv6 process implementation to maintain
                an exit status.  To get this done, add a field to the process
                structure (see proc.h) in order to save an exit status of the
                terminated process.  We will need this for implementing wait.  Next, you
                have to change all system calls affected by this change (e.g., exit,
                wait etc.).
  
  
  
              </p>
  
              <p><b>a) Change the exit system call signature to void exit(int
                status).</b> The exit system call must act as previously defined (i.e.,
                terminate the current process) but it must also store the exit status
                of the terminated process in the corresponding structure.  In order to
                make the changes in exit system call you must update the following
                files: user.h, defs.h, sysproc.c, proc.c and all the user space
                programs that uses exit system call.  Note, from now on, all user
                space programs must supply an exit status when terminated.
  
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Hassle: one hassle that this change (and the one in part b below)
                introduces is that all existing places that used exit(), including
                ones that are in test programs have now to be changed to use the new
                prototype.  You can either do that yourself (e.g., use grep to find
                all locations of this call and change them), or create a new exit call
                to match the new prototype.
  
              </p>
  
              <p>Goals of this part of the assignment: Get familiar with system call
                arguments and how arguments are passed given the presence of two
                stacks (user mode and kernel mode).  Understand the backward
                compatibility hassles that come from modifying the system call
                prototype.  Carry out a gentle modification to an existing system call
                and to the Process Control Block (PCB), which will be needed by the
                next part of the Lab.
  
              </p>
              <p><b>b) Update the wait system call signature to int wait(int
                *status).</b> The wait system call must prevent the current process from
                execution until any of its child processes is terminated (if any
                exists) and return the terminated child exit status through the status
                argument.  The system call must return the process id of the child
                that was terminated or -1 if no child exists (or unexpected error
                occurred).  Note that the wait system call can receive NULL as an
                argument. In this case the childâ€™s exit status must be discarded.
  
              </p>
              <p>Goal of this part of the assignment: Continue to get familiar with
                system call arguments, in this case with how to return a value.
  
              </p>
              <p><b>c) Add a waitpid system call: int waitpid(int pid, int *status, int
                options).</b>  This system call must act like wait system call with the
                following additional properties: The system call must wait for a
                process (not necessary a child process) with a pid that equals to one
                provided by the pid argument.  The return value must be the process id
                of the process that was terminated or -1 if this process does not
                exist or if an unexpected error occurred.  We are required only to
                implement a blocking waitpid where the kernel prevents
                the current process from execution until a process with the given pid
                terminates.
  
  
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>d) Write an example program to illustrate that your waitpid works.</b>  You
                have to modify the makefile to add your example program so that it can
                be executed from inside the shell once xv6 boots.
  
              </p>
              <br><br>
              <h3>4. Help, hints, questions to explore, etc...</h3>
  
              I will be extending this section based on how I see progress (for
              example, to help you understand the code base, or provide ideas to
              make you more effective in working with the code base).
  
              <ul>
                <li><b>Investing in learning gdb will really make your life easier this semester!</b>
                  There are only a few commands that you need to learn to get started.
                  <ul>
                      <li><tt> break</tt> places a break point which causes the program to stop when it reaches that point.  There are many ways to set a break point; I like to use <tt>break function</tt>  to cause a stop at the function that I want to look at.
    
                      </li><li><tt> continue</tt> causes gdb to continue execution until the next break point.  If you want to execute only one line of the code use <tt>next</tt> or <tt>step</tt>.  The difference between the two is if the next line contains a function call, next will execute the full call before stopping while step steps into the function and stops at the first line there.
    
                      </li><li><tt> print</tt> allows you to examine a variable.  You can use some of the C semantics here, for example to derference a pointer and see the memory location its point to (e.g., print *p), to print a specific format such as string or hex (e.g., print %x p).  <tt> display</tt> is like print but it repeats the print every time gdb stops (e.g., after a break point or after a step or next)
  
                      </li><li><tt> list</tt> shows the code around the area you are.
    
                        <p>You can find more gdb help in the gdb resources linked on the class page under resources.
                        </p></li></ul>
    
                      </li>
                      <li>Another really useful tool is <tt>grep</tt>.  You can grep for a keyword (or if you are adventureous, a regular expression) in a file or group of files to find if/where it exists.  So, lets say I am interested in a specific function or variable and want to see where it is used.  In the xv6 directory, you can type: <tt>grep wait *.c</tt> to search for the string in all files ending with .c
                        <p>There are a couple of other useful options for grep.  The <tt> -i </tt> option (e.g., <tt> grep -i wait *.c</tt> will make grep ignore case.  The <tt> -v</tt> option excludes a pattern.  So, lets say you want to search for wait, but not waitpid.  One way you can do it is <tt>grep wait *.c | grep -v waitpid</tt>
    
                        </p>
                      </li>
  
                      <li>(Background/deeper understanding): When any event in
                          xv6 occurs, the hardware switches mode to the operating system, and
                          jumps to the code in trapasm.S (starting at label alltraps).  This
                          code builds the trap frame (first segment), and then sets up the
                          memory segments for the kernel (second segment--unimportant for now).
    
                          <p>The trap frame is a data structure built on the stack that is used to
                            pass some important arguments to the trap handler including pointers
                            to the user stack to enable getting arguments to system calls.  Note
                            that the user stack and the kernel stack for a process are separate.
                            We discussed why in class.  So, when we push arguments for a system
                            call on the user stack, we need to give a pointer to the kernel to be
                            able to access them.
    
                          </p>
    
                          <p>You can see the trapframe structure in x86.h -- its ok to abstract
                            it away since we will not be working with it in detail.
    
                          </p>
                          <p>After filling parts of the trapframe, it calls trap() with the trap frame as argument, which takes us to trap in trap.c
    
                          </p>
                          <p>Here you find a big switch statment based on the trapno that caused
                            the trap (this is stored in the trap frame).  Each case represents an
                            event and implements its trap handler.  Only a few events are
                            currently supported such as system calls and the timer interrupt which
                            are necessary for the barebones xv6 to run.
    
                          </p>
                          <p>If you look under the system call case (the first case), you see
                            some sanity checks (OS code is typically paranoid to avoid kernel
                            panics), you see that we eventually call syscall() which is the top
                            level handler for system calls.  Lets follow syscall which is located
                            at the bottom of syscall.c
    
                          </p>
                          <p>We get the system call number from the eax register in the user
                            code (saved on the trapframe) and use it to index into the system call
                            table and pick up the appropriate handler to call.  The return value
                            from the system call handler is stored in the register eax in the
                            trapframe (which is used by convention to store return values in
                            Linux/x86) to provide the return value back to the user.
    
                          </p>
                          <p>The handlers are all of the same function type (they are all called
                            sys_xyz where xyz is the system call they handle) which enables us to
                            use this trap handler table and call any one of them as appropriate.
    
                          </p>
                          <p>Lets look at the implementation of one of these, lets say sys_kill()
                            which passes a signal to a process, often to kill it.
    
                          </p>
                          <p>sys_kill() and several other handlers are implemented in sysproc.c
                            because they have to do with processes.  Other handlers are
                            implemented in the file system code, or memory code as appropriate to
                            their operation.  Use grep to find them if you can't figure out where
                            they are.
    
                          </p>
                          <p> You will note that sys_kill eventually calls kill where the real
                            implementation of the system call is.  This enables us to pass
                            different parameters to each system call to get around the fact that the sys_ handler are all the same type.
    
                          </p>
                          <p>Note also that sys_kill had to get those parameters fro the user
                            stack.  To help with this low level read, there are a number of
                            accessor functions (argint, argstr, etc...) defined to get access to
                            the arguments based by the user by using information in the trapframe.

                    <ul>
                      <li>All code changes you made on xv6 source code (hint: <kbd>diff -r original_xv6 your_xv6</kbd>)
                      </li>
                      <li>Detailed explanation about these changes
                      </li>
                      <li>Screenshots about how you run the related program(s) and results
