	  <p class="mb-5">Hi, Welcome! I am an assistant professor of computer science at Singapore Management University. Before SMU, I was a Gladwin Development Chair Assistant Professor at Illinois Institute of Technology. I had the postdoctoral training at Cornell University and University of Utah, working with <a href="http://elaineshi.com/">Prof. Elaine Shi</a> & <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/muzhang82/">Prof. Mu Zhang</a>, and obtained my PhD in Computer Science from UC Riverside in 2019, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~heng/index.html">Prof. Heng Yin</a>. My research interests mainly lie in different aspects of Computer Security, including mobile security, system security, software testing, blockchain security and AI security. I enjoy solving emerging security problems by leveraging program analysis techniques and deep learning.</p>

		   I am actively looking for motivated students (including Postdocs, PhD students, visiting students and research engineers) to join my research group at SMU. Please make sure you have <b>seriously</b> read some of my recent papers and have strong interest in software security research. More details can be found <a href="ad.pdf">here</a>. I highly recommend that you read through these <a href="https://uvasrg.github.io/prospective/">great suggestions</a> before sending emails.<br>
