  <h3>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
  <p>In this part, you’ll be making changes to the xv6 memory layout.
  Sound simple? Well, there are a few tricky details.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="details">
  <h3>Details<a class="headerlink" href="#details" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
  <p>In xv6, the VM system uses a simple two-level page table.
  If you do not remember the details, read <a class="reference external" href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/vm-smalltables.pdf">Section 20.3</a>
  of OS 3 easy steps. However, you may find the description in
  Chapter 1 of the xv6 manual sufficient (and more relevant to the assignment).</p>
  <p>The xv6 address space is currently set up like this:</p>
  <div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">code</span>
  <span class="n">stack</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fixed</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">sized</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">one</span> <span class="n">page</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">heap</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">grows</span> <span class="n">towards</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">high</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">end</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">address</span> <span class="n">space</span><span class="p">)</span>
  </pre></div>
  </div>
  <p>In this part of the xv6 project, you’ll rearrange the address space to
  look more like Linux:</p>
  <div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">code</span>
  <span class="n">heap</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">grows</span> <span class="n">towards</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">high</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">end</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">address</span> <span class="n">space</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="o">...</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">gap</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="n">stack</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">at</span> <span class="n">end</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">address</span> <span class="n">space</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">grows</span> <span class="n">backwards</span><span class="p">)</span>
  </pre></div>
  </div>
  <p>You can see the general map of the kernel memory in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">memlayout.h</span></code>;
  the user memory starts at 0 and goes up to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">KERNBASE</span></code>.
  <strong>Note that we will not be changing the kernel memory layout at all,
  only the user memory layout</strong>.</p>
  <p>Right now, the program memory map is determined by how we load the
  program into memory and set up the page table (so that they are
  pointing to the right physical pages).  This is all implemented in
  exec.c as part of the exec system call using the underlying support
  provided to implement virtual memory in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vm.c</span></code>.  To change the memory
  layout, you have to change the exec code to load the program and
  allocate the stack in the new way that we want.</p>
  <p>Moving the stack up will give us space to allow it to grow, but it
  complicates a few things.  For example, right now xv6 keeps track of
  the end of the virtual address space using one value (sz).  Now you
  have to keep more information potentially e.g., the end of the bottom
  part of the user memory (i.e., the top of the heap, which is called
  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">brk</span></code> in Un*x), and bottom page of the stack.</p>
  <p>Once you figure out in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec.c</span></code> where xv6 allocates and initializes
  the user stack; then, you’ll have to figure out how to change that to
  use a page at the high-end of the xv6 user address space, instead of
  one between the code and heap.</p>
  <p>Some tricky parts: Let me re-emphasize: one thing you’ll have to be
  very careful with is how xv6 currently tracks the size of a process’s
  address space (currently with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sz</span></code> field in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">proc</span></code> struct).
  There are a number of places in the code where this is used (e.g.,
  to check whether an argument passed into the kernel is valid; to copy
  the address space). We recommend keeping this field to track the size of
  the code and heap, but doing some other accounting to track the stack,
  and changing all relevant code (i.e., that used to deal with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sz</span></code>)
  to now work with your new accounting.  Note that this potentially
  includes the shared memory code that you are writing for part 2.</p>

  <h2>Part 2: Growing the Stack<a class="headerlink" href="#part-2-growing-the-stack" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
  <p>The final item, which is challenging: automatically growing the
  stack backwards when needed.  Getting this to work will make you into
  a kernel boss, and also get you those last 10% of credit.  Briefly,
  here is what you need to do.  When the stack grows beyond its
  allocated page(s) it will cause a page fault because it is accessing
  an unmapped page.  If you look in traps.h, this trap is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">T_PGFLT</span></code>
  which is currently not handled in our trap handler in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">trap.c</span></code>.
  This means that it goes to the default handling of unknown traps,
  and causes a kernel panic.</p>
  <p>So, the first step is to add a case in trap to handle page
  faults. For now, your trap handler should simply check if the page
  fault was caused by an access to the page right under the current top
  of the stack.  If this is the case, we allocate and map the page, and
  we are done.  If the page fault is caused by a different address, we
  can go to the default handler and do a kernel panic like we did
  before.</p>
  <p>Bonus (5%): Write code to try and get the stack to grow into the
  heap.  Were you able to?  If not explain why in detail showing the
  relevant code.</p>

  <p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> Check the <a class="reference internal" href="#survive-guide"><span class="std std-ref">Survival guide</span></a> to walk you through this assignment.</p>
  <p><strong>Particularly useful for this project:</strong>
  Chapter 1 of xv6 + anything else about <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fork()</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec()</span></code>,
  as well as virtual memory.</p>
  <p>Take a look at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec</span></code> code in exec.c which loads a

  such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">allocuvm</span></code> (which uses <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mappages</span></code>).  These will be very
  instructive for implementing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">shm_open</span></code> (in lab 4) – we are
  allocating a new page the first time (similar to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">allocuvm</span></code>) and
  adding it to the page table (similar to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mappages</span></code>).</p>
  <p>It may be helpful to try to answer these questions to yourself:</p>

  <p>From assignment:</p>
  <p>Right now, the program memory map is determined by how we load the
  program into memory and set up the page table (so that they are
  pointing to the right physical pages).  This is all implemented in
  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec.c</span></code> as part of the exec system call using the underlying support
  provided to implement virtual memory in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vm.c</span></code>.  To change the memory
  layout, you have to change the exec code to load the program and
  allocate the stack in the new way that we want.</p>
  <p>Specifically, lets start by opening up <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec.c</span></code> check the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec(...)</span></code>
  function which implements the system call.  Exec does the following:</p>
  <section id="part-1">
  <h3>Part 1.<a class="headerlink" href="#part-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
  <p>Opens the executable file and parses it.  The rest of this
  paragraph is FYI.  Typically executable files are made up of a header
  including information that allows us to index the rest of the file.
  The file after that consists of sections including the code, the
  global data, and sometimes other sections like uninitialized data.
  These are the parts of the memory that we need to initialize from the
  executable.  The header information includes the number of sections,
  the start of each section in the file, and where it maps to in virtual
  memory, and the length of each section.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="part-2">
  <h3>Part 2.<a class="headerlink" href="#part-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
  <p>Initializes the kernel memory using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setupkvm()</span></code> which maps the
  pages of the kernel to the process address space.  We dont really need
  to know what happens in here.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="part-3">
  <h3>Part 3.<a class="headerlink" href="#part-3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
  <p>It then moves on to load the sections of the executable file
  into memory using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">loaduvm()</span></code> which creates the memory pages for each
  section and maps them to the address space (by initializing the page
  table pointers – more details in a bit).  These sections in xv6 are
  loaded starting at VA 0, and going up.  Each new section starts at the
  beginning of a new page.  Recall that sections include code,
  global/static data, etc..</p>
  <p>Conveniently, we can then keep track of where the user address space
  ends, which also defines the size of the process using one value
  (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">proc-&gt;sz</span></code>).  So, as we map new pages, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sz</span></code> (rounded up to the
  next page) can serve as their virtual address since we are simply
  filling in the address space sequentially.</p>
  <p>In VM, we map virtual pages to physical frames.  XV6 has no swap so
  all memory pages have to be in physical memory.  Physical memory is
  allocated by the kernel allocator <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kmalloc</span></code>.  If you want to dig
  deeper (you need to for the bonus part) you will see how these pages
  are initialized using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kinit()</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kinit2()</span></code> which are called
  during the boot process in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">main.c</span></code>.  As a result, we use
  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kmalloc()</span></code> as we request each new page inside <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vm.c</span></code> to allocate
  a new physical page.</p>
  <p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vm.c</span></code> functions such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">allocuvm()</span></code> typically follow this up
  with a call to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mappages</span></code> which is used to initialize the page table
  entries mapping the virtual address to the physical page that it just
  allocated.  Otherwise these physical frames that we allocate cannot be
  used by our process.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="part-4">
  <h3>Part 4.<a class="headerlink" href="#part-4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
  <p>At this point, we loaded code and data sections, and its time
  to create the stack.  xv6 does not support a heap at the moment (there
  is no <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">malloc()/free()</span></code> available to user programs if you noticed).
  It currently maps the stack in its virtual address space at a page right
  after the last page we loaded from the executable (i.e., at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sz</span></code>
  rounded up to the next page boundary).</p>
  <p>Since the stack grows down, allocating a page here means there is no
  room to grow the stack – as it grows down, it will run into the
  code/data.  To protect against that, xv6 adds one page buffer and
  marks it as unreadable so that in case the stack grows, we get a
  memory error and can stop the program.  The code to create the stack is:</p>

  </div>
  <p>TODO 1: This is the part of the code that we need to change to move
  the stack.  The current code calls allocuvm to create two pages,
  one for the stack and one as a guard page starting at VA <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sz</span></code> which
  is right after the code and data.  It then clears the page table entry
  for the guard page.</p>
  <p>We want to locate the stack starting at the top of the
  user address space to give it room to grow.  To understand what we
  need to do, lets look at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">allocuvm</span></code>.</p>
  <p>It takes 3 parameters:</p>
  <ol class="arabic simple">
  <li><p>The page table (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pgdir</span></code>).  This will not change</p></li>
  <li><p>The virtual address of the first page we are mapping – this needs
  to change to point to the top page of the user part of memory (right
  under <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">KERNBASE</span></code>).  If you use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kernbase</span></code>, you will try to map
  the page to the kernel address space.</p></li>
  <li><p>The virtual address of the last page we are mapping.  For us, we
  are creating a stack with only a single page, so this can another
  address in the same page, slightly bigger than the first address.</p></li>
  </ol>
  <p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">allocuvm</span></code> allocates the page, and maps it to the page table.  So,
  basically we are done with moving the stack by just changing these
  parameters to the right value.  However, there are a few loose ends to
  tie up.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="part-5">
  <h3>Part 5.<a class="headerlink" href="#part-5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
  <p>Finally, we initialize the stack pointer, currently to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sz</span></code>.</p>
  <p>TODO 2: you will have to change this to the address of the top word in
  the stack page.  Note that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">KERNBASE</span></code> is the first word in the kernel
  address space, so this is the word right under that.</p>
  <p>We proceed to initialize the stack with the parameters for main as per
  the linux/x86 stack convention.  The details are not important to us
  for now.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="loose-ends-other-changes">
  <h3>Loose Ends/Other changes.<a class="headerlink" href="#loose-ends-other-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
  <p>Now that we moved the stack, a few places in the Kernel that hard
  coded the previous location of the stack have to be changed.  These
  include:</p>
  <p>TODO 3: All of the functions that are defined in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">syscall.c</span></code>
  (and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sysfile.c</span></code>) for accessing the user stack have some checks to
  see if the addresses are indeed on the stack.  These checks compare
  the address against <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sz</span></code> since that was the top of the stack in the
  old implementation.  You have to change those checks (or remove them
  if it is easier).  Check all the accessor functions such as
  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">argint,</span> <span class="pre">argstr,</span> <span class="pre">argptr,</span> <span class="pre">argfd,</span></code> etc…</p>
  <p>TODO 4: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">copyuvm()</span></code>.  This function is used as part of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fork()</span></code>
  to create a copy of the address space of the parent process calling
  fork to the child process.  It is implemented in vm.c</p>
  <p>If you look at this function, it is one big for loop that iterates
  over the virtual address space and copies the pages one by one.
  The loop starts with:</p>
  <div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">sz</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">PGSIZE</span><span class="p">){</span>
  </pre></div>
  </div>
  <p>since it assumes the virtual address space starts at 0 and goes to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sz</span></code>.
  Now this has to be changed to take into account the new stack.</p>
  <p>If we look deeper, it reads the page table to get the PTE for the
  page, allocates a new physical frames, and copies the page from the
  parent memory to the new page.  Finally it uses <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mappages</span></code> to map this
  new copy to the child address space by adding a PTE to its page table.</p>
  <p>How do we change it?  Now <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sz</span></code> tracks the bottom part of the address
  space, so its ok to leave that loop alone.  We have to keep track of
  the size of the stack, and added another loop that iterates over the
  stack page(s) and does the same thing (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kmallocs</span></code> a page for each one,
  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">memmoves</span></code> to create a copy from the parent, and then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mapages()</span></code>
  to add it to page table).</p>
  <p>The loop will be very similar, with the exception of the virtual
  address ranges that iterates over.  Before we add stack growth, the
  stack is only one page, but as the stack grows we need to keep track
  of the number of stack pages. To prepare for this, we need to add a
  variable in struct proc to keep track of the size of the stack (in
  pages or bytes–either is fine, but I recommend pages).  This counter
  starts out with a stack of one page; set it in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exec()</span></code>.</p>
  <p>Debugging: If your stack moved correctly, xv6 will be able to boot
  into shell successfully.</p>
  <p>If you don’t allocate/map the stack correctly, you will get errors
  either in the allocation functions (e.g., remapping errors) or as your
  program runs (page faults).</p>
  <p>If you don’t take care of all the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">argint()</span></code> etc.. functions some of
  your system calls will not be able to pass parameters correctly.  The
  results could be weird.  For example, printf won’t print, and wait
  wont wait (leading to init continuing to fork processes, etc…)</p>

  <h3>Growing the stack.<a class="headerlink" href="#growing-the-stack" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
  <p>Now that our stack has been moved, we have room to grow it.  When the
  a program causes the stack to grow to an offset bigger than one page,
  at this point, we will be accessing a page that is not
  allocated/mapped.  This will cause a page fault.  Basically, we will
  trap to the trap handler in trap.c</p>
  <p>In there there is a switch statement with a case for every supported
  trap.  We need to add a case for page faults.  This page fault has
  trap number 14 (or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">T_PGFLT</span></code>) as defined in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">traps.h</span></code>.</p>
  <p>TODO 5: Add a case for the page fault.  When a page fault occurs,
  you can check the address that caused the page fault in a hardware
  register called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CR2</span></code>.  The CR register (standing for Control
  Register) keep track of important hardware state information.
  You can read the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CR2</span></code> register using the function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rcr2()</span></code>.</p>
  <p>Once you have the offending address, next we need to check if it is
  from the page right under the current bottom of the stack.  If it is,
  we need to grow the stack.  You can use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">allocuvm</span></code> again, but you have
  to initialize it with the right parameters to allocate one page at the
  right place.  After that, you can increment your stack size counter,
  which finishes your trap handler.</p>
  <p>Voila! you should be good to go.</p>
  <p>To check if the stack grows correctly, write a recursive program that
  nests deep enough to get a stack longer than 1 page.  You should get a
  page fault and grow the stack correctly if your implementation works.</p>
